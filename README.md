# Generative Conformance Specification Framework

The **Generative Conformance Specification Framework (GCSF)** defines a portable,
machine-readable format for describing how software should behave.

It provides:
- A **schema** for writing conformance specifications.
- **Reference runners** for verifying those specifications across languages.

Each specification describes expected behaviour as executable test cases —
so any implementation, human-written or AI-generated, can be verified
against the same standard.
